Welcome to the OpenSDN Community!
=========================================

OpenSDN (formerly known as Contrail/OpenContrail/Tungsten Fabric) is a secure software
defined networking project designed for the cloud native, multicloud
environment. Placing it on top of any IP network allows you to have a
single portal for defining, monitoring, and analyzing your entire
multicloud network, its security, and its performance.

Using OpenSDN, you can write and deploy network and security
policies that are portable to any cloud environment. All of your clouds
can have a consistent and easily maintainable configuration.
Standardized policies will make your security team happy, too.

.. warning::
   OpenSDN was formerly know as Contrail, OpenContrail, and Tungsten Fabric (TF). Please
   treat this documentation with care.  References to the above may still be in many
   parts of the documentation.

TODO
----
. Get rid of marginal or rarely used features and configurations (e.g. OpenShift support)
