Using Sandump Tool​
===================

:date: 2020-11-10

Starting with OpenSDN Release 2008, *Sandump* tool is
available in contrail-tools container. You can use the *Sandump* tool on
macOS machines.

Sandump tool captures the Sandesh messages from netlink connection
between Agent and vRouter (only DPDK mode) and provides interpretation
of all the captured bytes.​

Starting with OpenSDN Release 2011, you can use *Sandump*
tool on Windows machines.

Sandesh is a southbound interface protocol based on Apache Thrift, to
send analytics data such as system logs, object logs, UVEs, and flow logs.

You can analyze the captured bytes in Wireshark. The Wireshark plugin
parses the hex dumps of all Sandesh objects. You must use Wireshark
Release 3.2 and later.

You must have Wireshark application installed on your machine. You can
download Wireshark from the `Download
Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org/#download>`__ page.

For more details on Wireshark, see https://www.wireshark.org/docs/.

Follow the procedure to use Sandump tool:

1. Run the ``sandump`` command. It gives summary of each message which
   is being transferred between the agent and the vRouter.​

   ``(vrouter-agent-dpdk)[root]$ ./sandump -h``

   ::

      Sandump - Sandesh dump utility
      Usage:
             ./sandump -w <filename> [filename to write the sandesh packets]
             ./sandump -c <filename> [force cleanup]
      (vrouter-agent-dpdk)[root]$                                 
2. Copy the output into a file.

   ``(vrouter-agent-dpdk)[root]$ ./sandump -w <filename>.pcap``

   ::

      Dumping into <filename>.pcap
      Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
      Capturing on 'lo'
      12 ^C
      ./sandump: closing...
      (vrouter-agent-dpdk)[root]$

   The command generates a file which contains sniffed bytes converted
   in to the pcap format.

3. Analyze the captured packets transferred between the agent and the
   vRouter.

   ``(vrouter-agent-dpdk)[root]$ ./sandump``

   ::

      Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.

4. Analyze the pcap file in WireShark.

   -  Follow the procedure to analyze the packets in Wireshark for
      Windows OS.

      1. Download the ``sandump_wireshark_plugin`` folder from the
         https://github.com/opensdn-io/tf-vrouter/tree/master/utils/sandump
         repository.

      2. Copy the ``sandump_wireshark_plugin/main.lua`` file in
         ``C:\Program Files\Wireshark\plugins\`` folder.

         Create new lua folder in ``C:\Program Files\Wireshark\`` and
         copy the rest of the lua files present in
         ``sandump_wireshark_plugin`` folder to the newly created lua
         folder.

         .. note::

            Wireshark installation directory for 32-bit Windows is present
            in ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Wireshark\``\ and for 64-bit
            Windows is present in ``C:\Program Files\Wireshark\``.

      3. Run Notepad as administrator and open
         ``C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`` file.

      4. ​​​​​​​Add the host names with the following details:

         -  Agent IP address—0.0.0.0

         -  vRouter IP address—1.1.1.1

         Figure 1 shows the host file with the required IP addresses.
