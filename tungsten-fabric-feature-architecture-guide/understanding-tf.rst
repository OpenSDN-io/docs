Understanding Tungsten Fabric
=============================

:date: 2020-05-08

Tungsten Fabric provides dynamic end-to-end networking policy and
control for any cloud, any workload, and any deployment, from a single
user interface. It translates abstract workflows into specific policies,
simplifying the orchestration of virtual overlay connectivity across all
environments.

It unifies policy for network automation with seamless integrations for
systems such as: Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mesos, OpenStack, VMware, a
variety of popular DevOps tools like Ansible, and a variety of Linux
operating systems with or without virtualization like KVM and Docker
containers.

Tungsten Fabric reduces the friction of migrating to cloud by
providing a virtual networking overlay layer that delivers virtual
routing, bridging, and networking services (IPAM, NAT, security, load
balancing, VPNs, etc.) over any existing physical or cloud IP network.
It also provides multitenant structure and API compatibility with
multitenant public clouds like Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual private
clouds (VPCs) for truly unifying policy semantics for hybrid cloud
environments.

For service providers, Tungsten Fabric automates network resource
provisioning and orchestration to dynamically create highly scalable
virtual networks and to chain a rich set of Juniper Networks or
third-party virtualized network functions (VNFs) and physical network
functions (PNFs) to form differentiated service chains on demand.

Tungsten Fabric is equipped with always-on advanced analytics
capabilities to provide deep insights into application and
infrastructure performance for better visualization, easier diagnostics,
rich reporting, custom application development, and machine automation.

Tungsten Fabric also provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI).This
GUI is built entirely using the REST APIs.
