OpenSDN networking and security user guide
==========================================

Use this guide to understand how you can create and orchestrate highly secure 
virtual networks using OpenSDN. 
OpenSDN provides dynamic end-to-end networking policy and control 
for any cloud, any workload, and any deployment, from a single user interface. 
And unlike the conventional firewall configuration of IP addresses and port ranges, 
OpenSDN security implements intent-based policy framework that uses policy constructs 
such as tags, labels, application policy set, address groups, and service groups.
