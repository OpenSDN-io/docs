Integrating vCenter for Tungsten Fabric
=======================================

:date: 2020-03-10

These topics provide instructions for integrating Tungsten Fabric 5.1.x
and microservices with VMware vCenter.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you start the integration, ensure that the TF controller
meets the prerequisites given in 
:ref:`Server Requirements and Supported Platforms <ServerReqAndPlatform>`.

Follow these steps to prepare TF controller(s):

::

   yum update -y

   yum install -y yum-plugin-priorities https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

   yum install -y python-pip git gcc python-devel sshpass

   yum install -y git

   pip install “ansible==2.5.0” pyvmomi

ESX Agent Manager
-----------------

VMware provides a standard vCenter solution called vSphere ESX Agent
Manager (EAM), that allows you to deploy, monitor, and manage
ContrailVMs on ESXi hosts.

The ContrailVM is deployed as an Agent VM that is monitored by EAM. With
this integration, ContrailVMs are marked as more critical and privileged
than other tenant VMs on the host.

The following are the benefits of running ContrailVM as an AgentVM from
EAM:

-  Auto-deploy ContrailVMs on ESXi hosts in scope (clusters).

-  Manage and Monitor ContrailVMs through EAM in the vSphere web client.

-  Integrate with other vCenter features like AddHos, Maintenance Mode,
   vSphere DRS, vSphere DPM, and VMWare HA.

These topics provide instructions for integrating Tungsten Fabric 5.1.x
and microservices with VMware vCenter.

Set Up vCenter Server
---------------------

Follow these steps to set up the vCenter server.

1. Download the Tungsten Fabric Ansible Deployer
   (``contrail-ansible-deployer-< >.tgz``) onto your provisioning host.
   You can download the deployer from
   https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=contrail#sw.

2. Untar the ``tgz``.

   ``- tar xvf contrail-ansible-deployer-< >.tgz``

3. Prepare a ``vcenter_vars.yml`` file populated with vCenter server and
   ESXI hosts parameters. You can download the CentOS 7.5 and ESXi VM
   Host from
   https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=contrail#sw.
   
   .. Note:: 

      You can see a sample of the vcenter_vars.yml file in the
      ``contrail-ansible-deployer/playbooks/roles/vcenter/vars/vcenter_vars.yml``
      after you extract the image files.

   .. note::

      The ContrailVM’s Open Virtualization Format (OVF) image must be
      hosted on an http or https server which runs on and is reachable from
      the vCenter server. The location of the OVF is provided as a URL path
      for ``vmdk:`` as shown in the example given below.

   **Example: Enabling HA and DRS in the cluster**
   ::

      vcenter_servers:
        - SRV1:
            hostname: 
            username:
            password:
            # Optional: defaults to False
            #validate_certs: False
            datacentername: 
            clusternames:
            #path to the ovf, is needed for ESX Agent Manager to deploy ContrailVMs
            vmdk: http://<ip-address>/centos-7.5/LATEST/ContrailVM.ovf
            # Optional: If not specified HA and DRS are turned off on the clusters.
            enable_ha: yes
            enable_drs: yes

   For definition examples, refer
   ``contrail-ansible-deployer/playbooks/roles/vcenter/vars/vcenter_vars.yml.sample``.

   To enable HA and DRS in the cluster, set ``enable_ha`` and
   ``enable_drs`` to ``yes`` in the ``vcenter_vars.yml`` file. If these
   flags are not enabled, HA and DRS is turned off by default for newly
   created and existing clusters.

          vcenter_server: SRV1 #leave this

4. Run the TF vCenter playbook.

   ``ansible-playbook playbooks/vcenter.yml``

   .. note::

      Verify that the hostnames for the TF controller(s) and the
      ContrailVMs (vRouters) are unique in ``/etc/hostname`` file.

   You can verify hostname from either the DHCP options (if the
   management network uses DHCP) or manually (if the management network
   uses static IP allocation).

Configure TF Parameters
-----------------------

Populate the file ``config/instances.yaml`` with TF roles.

For an example file, see
``contrail-ansible-deployer/confing/instances.yaml.vcenter_example``.

Install TF
----------

Install TF by running the following TF playbooks:

``ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator=vcenter playbooks/configure_instances.yml``

``ansible-playbook -i inventory/ -e orchestrator=vcenter playbooks/install_contrail.yml``

Monitor and Manage ContrailVM from ESX Agent Manager
----------------------------------------------------

ContrailVMs can be monitored from EAM by using ContrailVM-Agency.

Follow these steps to monitor and manage TF VM from EAM:

1. Resolve issues from the ContrailVM-Agency.

   The ContrailVM-Agency is in an alert state when the ContrailVM in any
   host is powered off or is deleted.

   Click **Resolve All Issues** from the ContrailVM-Agency to correct
   the issue. The ContrailVM-Agency will attempt to correct the issue by
   bringing the ContrailVM back online or by spawning a ContrailVM from
   the OVF on the ESXi host.

   |Figure 1: vCenter Server Extensions|

   |Figure 2: ESX Agencies|

2. Add host.

   1. Add ESXi host to the cluster.

   2. Configure **Agent VM Settings** for the ESXI host.

      |Figure 3: Configure Agent VM Settings|

      For more information on configuring Agent VM, network, and
      datastore settings, see `Configure Agent VM
      Settings <https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-6BEC5198-5273-4592-ABD2-2E6E85873C16.html>`__.

      EAM deploys a ContrailVM (from the base OVF) on the ESXi host.

   3. Add ESXi host details to ``vcenter_vars.yml`` and repeat step
      4 to add
      appropriate interfaces to the ContrailVM and to configure
      necessary settings in the vCenter server.

   4. Add ContrailVM details to ``instances.yaml`` and provision
      TF on the newly added ContrailVm (router). 

3. Clean up the ContrailVM-Agency.

   Delete **ContrailVM-Agency** from the EAM user interface to delete
   ContrailVM and the agency.
