How to Perform a Zero Impact OpenSDN Upgrade using the Ansible Deployer
===============================================================================

:date: 2021-01-19

Starting in OpenSDN Release 2005, you can perform a Zero
Impact Upgrade (ZIU) of OpenSDN using the OpenSDN Ansible
Deployer container. The OpenSDN Ansible Deployer container image can be
loaded from the Juniper Networks Contrail Container Registry hosted at
``hub.juniper.net/contrail``.

Use the procedure in this document to perform a Zero Impact Upgrade
(ZIU) of OpenSDN using the OpenSDN Ansible Deployer
container. This ZIU allows OpenSDN to upgrade while
sustaining minimal network downtime.

Before you begin:

-  The target release for this upgrade must be Contrail Release 2005 or
   later.

-  You can use this procedure to incrementally upgrade to the next
   OpenSDN release only. For instance, if you are running
   OpenSDN Release 2003 and want to upgrade to the next
   OpenSDN Release—which is OpenSDN Release 2005—you can
   use this procedure to perform the upgrade.

   This procedure is not validated for upgrades between releases that
   are two or more releases apart. For instance, it could not be used to
   upgrade from OpenSDN Release 2002 to OpenSDN
   Release 2005.

   For a list of OpenSDN releases in a table that
   illustrates OpenSDN release order, see `Contrail
   Networking Supported
   Platforms <https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/release-independent/contrail/topics/reference/contrail-supported-platforms.pdf>`__  .

-  The OpenSDN Ansible Deployer container can only be used in CentOS
   environments.

-  Take snapshots of your current configurations before you proceed with
   the upgrade process. For details, refer to :ref:`How to Backup and Restore OpenSDN databases in JSON Format`.

This procedure illustrates how to perform a ZIU using the Ansible
deployer container. It includes a representative example of the steps
being performed to upgrade from OpenSDN Release 2005 to
Release 2008.

To perform the ZIU using the Ansible deployer:

1.  Pull the ``contrail-ansible-deployer`` file for the target upgrade
    release. This procedure is typically performed from a OpenSDN
    controller running in your environment, but it can also be performed
    from a separate server which has network connectivity to the
    deployment that is being upgraded.

    This procedure shows you how to load a 2008 image from the Juniper
    Networks Contrail Container Registry. You can, however, also change
    the values to load the file from a private registry.

    The Juniper Networks Contrail Container Registry is hosted at
    ``hub.juniper.net/contrail``. If you need the credentials to access
    the registry, email contrail-registry@juniper.net.

    Enter the following commands to pull the
    ``contrail-ansible-deployer`` file from the registry:

    ::

       sudo docker login -u <username> -p <password> hub.juniper.net 
       sudo docker pull hub.juniper.net/contrail/contrail-kolla-ansible-deployer:2008.<contrail_container_tag>

    where:

    -  ``username``—username to access the registry. Email
       contrail-registry@juniper.net if you need to obtain ``username``
       and ``password`` credentials.

    -  ``password``—password to access the registry. Email
       contrail-registry@juniper.net if you need to obtain ``username``
       and ``password`` credentials.

    -  ``contrail_container_tag``—the container tag ID for your target
       OpenSDN release. The ``contrail_container_tag`` for
       any Contrail Release 20 software can be obtained from `README
       Access to OpenSDN Registry
       20xx <https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/contrail20/information-products/topic-collections/release-notes/readme-contrail-20.pdf>`__  .

2.  Start the OpenSDN Ansible Deployer:

    ::

       docker run -t --net host -d --privileged --name contrail-kolla-ansible-deployer hub.juniper.net/contrail/contrail-kolla-ansible-deployer:2008.<contrail_container_tag>

3.  Navigate to the ``instances.yaml`` file and open it for editing.

    The ``instances.yaml`` file was used to initially deploy the setup.
    The ``instances.yaml`` can be loaded into the OpenSDN Ansible
    Deployer and edited to supported the target upgrade version.

    *OpenSDN Release 2008 Target Upgrade Example using VI as the
    editor*:

    ::

       docker cp instances.yaml contrail-kolla-ansible-deployer:/root/contrail-ansible-deployer/config/instances.yaml
       docker exec -it contrail-kolla-ansible-deployer bash
       cd /root/contrail-ansible-deployer/config/
       vi instances.yaml

4.  Update the ``CONTRAIL_CONTAINER_TAG`` to the desired version tag in
    the ``instances.yaml`` file from the existing deployment. The
    ``CONTRAIL_CONTAINER_TAG`` variable is in the
    ``contrail_configuration:`` hierarchy within the ``instances.yaml``
    file.

    The ``CONTRAIL_CONTAINER_TAG`` for any OpenSDN Release 20 software
    can be obtained from `README Access to OpenSDN Registry
    20xx <https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/contrail20/information-products/topic-collections/release-notes/readme-contrail-20.pdf>`__  .

    Here is an example instances.yml file configuration:

    ::

       contrail_configuration:
         CONTRAIL_CONTAINER_TAG: "2008.121"
         CONFIG_DATABASE_NODEMGR__DEFAULTS__minimum_diskGB: "2"
         DATABASE_NODEMGR__DEFAULTS__minimum_diskGB: "2"
         JVM_EXTRA_OPTS: "-Xms1g -Xmx2g"
         VROUTER_ENCRYPTION: FALSE
         LOG_LEVEL: SYS_DEBUG
         CLOUD_ORCHESTRATOR: kubernetes

5.  Upgrade the control plane by running the ziu.yml playbook file from
    inside the  container.

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2005 to OpenSDN
       Release 2008:

       Upgrade the control plane by running the ``ziu.yml`` playbook
       file.

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e orchestrator=openstack -e
       config_file=instances.yaml playbooks/ziu.yml

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2011 and later:

       Upgrade the control plane by running the controller stage of
       ``ziu.yml`` playbook file.

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=controller -e
       orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml
       playbooks/ziu.yml

6.  Upgrade the Openstack plugin by running the install_openstack.yml
    playbook file.

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2005 to OpenSDN
       Release 2008:

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e orchestrator=openstack -e
       config_file=instances.yaml playbooks/install_openstack.yml

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2011 and later:

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=openstack -e
       orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml
       playbooks/ziu.yml

7.  Enter the contrail-status command to monitor upgrade status. Ensure
    all pods reach the ``running`` state and all services reach the
    ``active`` state.

    This contrail-status command provides this output after a successful
    upgrade:

8.  Migrate workloads VM from one group of compute nodes. Leave them
    uncommented in the instances.yaml file. Comment other computes not
    ready to upgrаde in instances.yaml.

9.  Upgrade compute nodes.

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2005 to OpenSDN
       Release 2008:

       Run the install_contrail.yml playbook file to upgrade the compute
       nodes that were uncommented in the instances.yaml file. Only the
       compute nodes that were left uncommented in step 8
       are upgraded to the target release in this step.

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e orchestrator=openstack -e
       config_file=instances.yaml playbooks/install_contrail.yml

    -  For OpenSDN Release 2011 and later:

       Run the compute stage of ziu.yml playbook file to upgrade the
       compute nodes that were uncommented in the instances.yaml file.
       Only the compute nodes that were left uncommented in step 8
       are upgraded to the target release in this step.

       sudo -E ansible-playbook -v -e stage=compute -e
       orchestrator=openstack -e config_file=../instances.yaml
       playbooks/ziu.yml

10. Repeat Steps 8 and 9 until all compute nodes are upgraded.

You can access the Ansible playbook logs of the upgrade at
``/var/log/ansible.log``.


.. note::
   
   Starting in OpenSDN Release 2005, you can perform a Zero
   Impact Upgrade (ZIU) of OpenSDN using the OpenSDN Ansible
   Deployer container.
