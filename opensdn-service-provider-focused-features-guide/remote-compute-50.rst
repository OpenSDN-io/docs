Remote Compute
==============

:date: 2020-12-01

OpenSDN supports remote compute, a method of managing a
OpenSDN deployment across many small distributed data centers
efficiently and cost effectively.

Remote Compute Overview
-----------------------

Remote compute enables the deployment of OpenSDN in many
small distributed data centers, up to hundreds or even thousands, for
telecommunications point-of-presence (PoPs) or central offices (COs).
Each small data center has only a small number of computes, typically
5-20 in a rack, running a few applications such as video caching,
traffic optimization, and virtual Broadband Network Gateway (vBNG). It
is not cost effective to deploy a full OpenSDN controller cluster of
nodes of control, configuration, analytics, database, and the like, in
each distributed PoP on dedicated servers. Additionally, manually
managing hundreds or thousands of clusters is not feasible
operationally.

Remote Compute Features
-----------------------

Remote compute is implemented by means of a subcluster that manages
compute nodes at remote sites to receive configurations and exchange
routes.

The key concepts of OpenSDN remote compute include:

-  Remote compute employs a subcluster to manage remote compute nodes
   away from the primary data center.

-  The OpenSDN control cluster is deployed in large centralized data
   centers, where it can remotely manage compute nodes in small
   distributed small data centers.

-  A lightweight version of the controller is created, limited to the
   control node, and the config node, analytics, and analytics database
   are shared across several control nodes.

-  Many lightweight controllers are co-located on a small number of
   servers to optimize efficiency and cost.

-  The control nodes peer with the remote compute nodes by means of XMPP
   and peer with local gateways by means of MP-eBGP.

Remote Compute Operations
-------------------------

A subcluster object is created for each remote site, with a list of
links to local compute nodes that are represented as vrouter objects,
and a list of links to local control nodes that are represented as BGP
router objects, with an ASN as property.

The subclusters are identified in the provision script. The vrouter and
bgp-router provision scripts take each subcluster as an optional
argument to link or delink with the subcluster object.

It is recommended to spawn the control nodes of the remote cluster in
the primary cluster, and they are IGBP-meshed among themselves within
that subcluster. The control nodes BGP-peer with their respective SDN
gateway, over which route exchange occurs with the primary control
nodes.

Compute nodes in the remote site are provisioned to connect to their
respective control nodes to receive configuration and exchange routes.
Data communication among workloads between these clusters occurs through
the provider backbone and their respective SDN gateways. The compute
nodes and the control nodes push analytics data to analytics nodes
hosted on the primary cluster.

Subcluster Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenSDN WebUI shows a list of subcluster objects, each with a list
of associated vrouters and BGP routers that are local in that remote
site and the ASN property.

General properties of subclusters include:

-  A subcluster control node never directly peers with another
   subcluster control node or with primary control nodes.

-  A subcluster control node has to be created, and is referred to, in
   virtual-router and bgp-router objects.

-  A subcluster object and the control nodes under it should have the
   same ASN.

-  The ASN cannot be modified in a subcluster object.

.. note::

   Multinode service chaining across subclusters is not supported.

Inter Subcluster Route Filtering
--------------------------------

OpenSDN Release 2011 supports inter subcluster route
filtering (Beta). With this release, a new extended community called
``origin-sub-cluster`` (similar to ``origin-vn``) is added to all routes
originating from a subcluster.

The format of this new extended community is
:literal:`subcluster:<``asn``>:<``id``>`.

This new extended community is added by encoding the subcluster ID in
the ID field within the extended community. The subcluster ID helps you
determine the subcluster from which the route originated, and is unique
for each subcluster. For a 2-byte ASN format, type/subtype is 0x8085 and
subcluster ID can be 4-byte long. For a 4-byte ASN format, type/subtype
is 0x8285 and subcluster ID can be 2-byte long.

You create a routing policy matching this new extended community to be
able to filter routes. Routing policies are always applied to primary
routes. However, a routing policy is applied to a secondary route in the
following scenarios:

-  There is no subcluster extended community associated with the route.

-  Self subcluster ID does not match the subcluster ID associated with
   the route.

Figure 1 shows a data center network topology. All routing policies are configured on virtual
networks in the main data center, POP0. Consider the following example
routing policy:

``From 0/0 & subcluster:<asn>:1 then LP=150``

``From 0/0 & subcluster:<asn>:2  then LP=140``

``From 0/0 then reject``

Where, ``1`` and ``2`` are the subcluster IDs of subclusters POP1 and
POP2 respectively.

In this example, for routes directed to POP0 from subclusters POP1 and
POP2, the LP will be changed. Routes that do not match the extended
community are rejected. Default routes with no extended community are
also rejected.

Provisioning a Remote Compute Cluster
-------------------------------------

OpenSDN enables you to provision remote compute using an
``instances.yaml`` file. The YAML file described in this
section builds upon that minimum configuration and uses
Figure 1 as an example data center network topology.

|Figure 1: Example Multi-Cluster Topology|

In this topology, there is one main data center (``pop0``) and two
remote data centers (``pop1`` and ``pop2``.) ``pop0`` contains two
subclusters: one for ``pop1,`` and the other for ``pop2``. Each
subcluster has two control nodes. The control nodes within a subcluster,
for example 10.0.0.9 and 10.0.0.10, communicate with each other through
iBGP.

Communication between the control nodes within a subcluster and the
remote data center is through the SDN Gateway; there is no direct
connection. For example, the remote compute in pop1 (IP address
10.20.0.5) communicates with the control nodes (IP addresses 10.0.0.9
and 10.0.0.10) in subcluster 1 through the SDN Gateway.

To configure remote compute in the YAML file:

1. First, create the remote locations or subclusters. In this example,
   we create data centers 2 and 3 (with the names ``pop1`` and ``pop2``,
   respectively), and define unique ASN numbers for each. Subcluster
   names must also be unique.

   ::

      remote_locations:
        pop1:
          BGP_ASN: 12345
          SUBCLUSTER: pop1
        pop2:
          BGP_ASN: 12346
          SUBCLUSTER: pop2

2. Create the control nodes for pop1 and pop2 and assign an IP address
   and role. These IP addresses are the local IP address. In this
   example, there are two control nodes for each subcluster.

   ::

      control_1_only_pop1:           # Mandatory. Instance name
          provider: bms              # Mandatory. Instance runs on BMS
          ip: 10.0.0.9
          roles:
            control:
              location: pop1
        control_2_only_pop1:         # Mandatory. Instance name
          provider: bms              # Mandatory. Instance runs on BMS
          ip: 10.0.0.10
          roles:
            control:
              location: pop1 
        control_1_only_pop2:         # Mandatory. Instance name
          provider: bms              # Mandatory. Instance runs on BMS
          ip: 10.0.0.11
          roles:                     # Optional. 
            control:
              location: pop2
        control_2_only_pop2:         # Mandatory. Instance name
          provider: bms              # Mandatory. Instance runs on BMS
          ip: 10.0.0.12
          roles:                     # Optional. 
            control:
              location: pop2

3. Now, create the remote compute nodes for ``pop1`` and ``pop2`` and
   assign an IP address and role. In this example, there are two remote
   compute nodes for each data center. The 10.60.0.x addresses are the
   management IP addresses for the control service.
