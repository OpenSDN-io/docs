Installing and Provisioning OpenSDN VMware vRealize Orchestrator Plugin
=======================================================================

:date: 2019-08-09

A dedicated OpenSDN plugin is used to connect to VMware vRealize
Orchestrator (vRO). OpenSDN Release 5.0 supported a Beta version of the
plugin. Starting with OpenSDN Release 5.1, a fully supported version of
the plugin is available.

You must install the OpenSDN VMware vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) plugin
to connect to the vRO server.

Before you begin installation, ensure the following:

-  You have administrator-level access to the Control Center of a
   deployed vRO appliance.

-  You know the host name (*{vRO}*) of the deployed vRO Appliance.

-  You have the login credentials of the vCenter SSO service.

-  You have downloaded the vRO plugin package file to your local system.

   You can download the plugin from
   https://www.juniper.net/support/downloads/?p=contrail.

You can deploy the OpenSDN plugin in any Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
compatible environment and load it on an active vRO instance.

The following topics describe how to install and provision the OpenSDN
vRO plugin.

Accessing vRO Control Center
----------------------------

Follow the steps given below to access and log in to vRO Control Center:

1. To access vRO Control Center through a Web browser, navigate to the
   https://{vRO}:8283/vco-controlcenter URL.

   .. note::

      Replace *{vRO}* given in the URL with the *host name* of the deployed
      vRO Appliance.

      The *host name* is the IP address or the FQDN of the vRO node.

   The :guilabel:`vCenter SSO` service page is displayed.

         from the Manage Plug-Ins page.

      .. note::

         ``*.vmoapp`` or ``*.dar`` file format can be used. Also, the
         version in this example may be different from the version you have
         downloaded.

   -  Click :guilabel:`Browse` in the :guilabel:`Install plug-in` pane and select the
      downloaded vRO plugin package file on your local system.

download vRealize Orchestrator Client version 7.3.0 to access the vRO
server.

To download and install the vRO desktop client application, click
https://{vRO}:8281/vco/.

.. note::

   Replace *{vRO}* given in the URL with the *host name* of the deployed
   vRO Appliance.

You can download vRO desktop client applications for Windows, Mac OS X,
and Linux operating systems.

Connecting to vRO using the Desktop Client
------------------------------------------

You connect to the vRO server by using the vRO desktop client.

1. Start the vRO desktop client.

   The :guilabel:`VMware vRealize Orchestrator Login` page is displayed.

   |Figure 6: VMware vRealize Orchestrator Login page|

2. In the VMware vRealize Orchestrator Login page, enter **Host name**,
   **User name**, and **Password**.

   .. note::

      The **Host name** also includes the port number and must be in the
      **{vRO}:8281** format.

3. Click :guilabel:`Login` to connect to the vRO server.

Connecting to OpenSDN Controller
----------------------------------------

To connect OpenSDN vRO to the OpenSDN Controller:

1. Navigate to the :menuselection:`Contrail > Configuration` folder in the workflow
   library. 

2. Select :guilabel:`Create OpenSDN controller connection`.

   |Figure 7: Workflow Library|

3. Click the :guilabel:`Controller` tab and enter the following information:

   -  **Connection name**—a unique name to identify the connection

   -  **Controller host**—host name of the OpenSDN Connector

   -  **Controller port**—port used to access the OpenSDN Controller

   |Figure 8: Controller Tab|

4. Click the :guilabel:`Credentials` tab and enter the following credentials to
   manage the OpenSDN Controller:

   -  **User name**—user name to access the OpenSDN Controller
