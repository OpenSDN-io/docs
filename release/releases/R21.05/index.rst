Support for 4 Byte AS Number
----------------------------

OpenSDN now supports 4-byte or 32-bit Autonomous System (AS) numbers in BGP as specified in RFC 6793. The provision for 4-byte AS numbers is introduced to avoid exhaustion of AS numbers. You can now set an AS number in the range 1-4294967295. The default AS number is 64512. 

To start using AS value in the 4-byte range:

1. Navigate to Infrastructure > Cluster> Advanced Options page.

The Global Config tab is displayed, which lists all system configuration information.

2. Click the Edit icon. The Edit System Configuration dialog box is displayed.

3. Select Enabled option button under 4 Byte ASN field. To disable 4-byte ASN range, select Disabled.

You can now assign 2-byte or 16-bit AS number in the range 1-65535. To assign 4-byte value in Route Target(s) field:

1. Navigate to Overlay > Virtual Networks > Edit Virtual Network page to edit existing virtual network. Navigate to Overlay > Virtual Networks > Create Virtual Network page to create a new virtual network. 

2. Click Routing, Bridging and Policies.
Route Target(s) field is displayed.
Click +Add.

In the Route Target(s) section, you can now assign a 4-byte value in the range of 1-4,294,967,295 in the ASN field, when 4 Byte ASN is enabled in Global Config. If you assign the ASN field a 4-byte value, you must assign a 2-byte value in the range of 0-65,535 in the Target field. You can also assign a 2-byte value in the range of 1-65,535 in the ASN field, when 4 Byte ASN is disabled in Global Config. If you assign the ASN field a 2-byte value, you must assign a 4-byte value in the range of 0-4,294,967,295 in the Target field. You can also add suffix L or l (lower-case L) at the end of a value in the ASN field to assign the value in 4-byte range. Even if the value provided in the ASN field is in the range of 1-65,535, adding L or l (lower-case L) at the end of the value assigns it in 4-byte range. If you assign the ASN field a value in the 4-byte range, you must enter a value in the range of 0-65,535 in the Target field.


Encryption Support for Redis Traffic
------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports an SSL encrypted tunneling program called stunnel to secure Redis traffic. The stunnel is used to route traffic between Redis clients and servers. SSL encryption in the stunnel acts as a layer of security when OpenSDN analytics client processes connect to a Redis instance server. In prior releases connection requests sent from tf-analytics clients to Redis server sometimes posed security threats since Redis did not support encryption. The stunnel feature is supported only when OpenSDN is deployed with Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP).


Support for OpenSDN Deployment with Kubernetes Using Juju Charms
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Starting in Release 21.05, you can deploy OpenSDN with Kubernetes by using Juju Charms. Juju helps you deploy, configure, and efficiently manage applications on private clouds and public clouds. A Charm is a module containing a collection of scripts and metadata and is used with Juju to deploy OpenSDN. Juju Charms helps reduce the complexity of deploying OpenSDN by providing a simple way to deploy, configure, scale, and manage OpenSDN operations. OpenSDN now supports the following charms: 

• contrail-kubernetes-master
• contrail-kubernetes-node

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/deploying-tf-using-juju-charms-kubernetes.html>`_


Support for Netronome SmartNIC vRouter
--------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports Netronome Agilio CX for OpenSDN
deployment with Red Hat OpenStack Platform Director (RHOSPd) 13 environment. This
feature will enable increased packets per second (PPS) capacity of OpenSDN vRouter
datapath allowing applications to reach their full processing capacity. Additionally, it allows to reclaim CPU cores from OpenSDN vRouter off-loading permitting more VMs and
VNFs to be deployed per server.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/smartnic-vrouter-support.html>`_

Support for OpenSDN with Kubernetes in Nested Mode by Using Juju Charms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports provisioning of a Kubernetes cluster inside an OpenStack cluster. OpenSDN Networking offers a nested control and data plane where a single control plane and a single network stack can manage and service both the OpenStack and Kubernetes clusters. In nested mode, a Kubernetes cluster is provisioned in virtual machines of an OpenStack cluster. The CNI plugin and the OpenSDN Kubernetes manager of the Kubernetes cluster interface directly with OpenSDN components that manage the OpenStack cluster. All Kubernetes features, functions and specifications are supported in nested mode. For more information, see Installing OpenSDN with Kubernetes in Nested Mode by Using Juju Charms.
`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/juju-charms-nested-kubernetes.html>`_


Encryption Support Between Analytics API Servers and Client Servers
-------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports the connection between Analytics API servers and Client servers encrypted with SSL. The Clients servers connect to the Analytics API server through the REST API Port. In earlier releases, the connection between Analytics API server and the Clients servers was not encrypted, which could pose a security threat.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-monitoring-and-troubleshooting-guide/encrypting-connection-analytics-server-and-client-server.html>`_

Enhanced Routing Policies to Support Modification of Secondary Routes in Virtual Networks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports virtual network routing policies automatically applied to secondary routes. This feature is especially useful as a mechanism to modify routes imported from MP-BGP, including routes that are imported from the MPLS network, using routing policies.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-service-provider-focused-features-guide/tf-routing-policy-sp-features.html>`_

Support for Trunk Networking Between OpenSDN Networking and Neutron
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now integrates with Neutron trunk port APIs, which enables trunk networking between OpenSDN and Neutron instances. Trunk networking uses trunk extension that is used to multiplex incoming and outgoing packets from multiple Neutron logical networks using a single Neutron logical port. A trunk extension is integrated in Neutron as a collection of Neutron logical ports. In the trunk extension that is implemented, OpenSDN introduces logical entities defined by OpenStack Trunk API to provide backend support for Neutron Trunk Port API. The Neutron Trunk Port object maps to OpenSDN Virtual Port Group (VPG) object, which was designed for handling non-LCM BMS workflow and multi-VLAN support.


Support for Increased vRouter Next Hop Limit and Monitoring Next Hop and MPLS Labels Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports an increased next hop value in the vRouter to 32 bits. By default, the vRouter creates 512K next hops and it supports up to 1 million next hops. You can also now configure a watermark limit in vRouter agent configuration file, which enables you to monitor the usage and availability of next hops and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) labels. In earlier releases, OpenSDN vRouter supported 16 bits next hop value, which enabled it to create a maximum of only 65,536 next hops.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-networking-and-security-user-guide/next-hop-limit-increase.html>`_

Enhanced DPDK vRouter Performance Through Full CPU Partitioning and Isolation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports full CPU partitioning. CPU isolation is an RHEL method to partition and isolate the CPU cores on a compute node from the symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) balancing and scheduler algorithms. The full CPU isolation feature optimizes the performance of DPDK vRouter when deployed with the DPDK settings recommended for RHOSP. To enable full CPU partitioning and isolation, you need to configure tuned and isolcpus.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-service-provider-focused-features-guide/vrouter-isolcpu.html>`_

Inter Subcluster Route Filtering
--------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports inter subcluster route filtering. With this release, a new extended community called origin-sub-cluster (similar to origin-vn) is added to all routes originating from a subcluster. The format of this new extended community is subcluster::. This new extended community is added by encoding the subcluster ID in the ID field within the extended community. The subcluster ID helps you determine the subcluster from which the route originated, and is unique for each subcluster.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-service-provider-focused-features-guide/remote-compute-50.html>`_

Zero Impact Upgrade: Upgrading OpenSDN Networking Software without Rebooting Compute Nodes with Kernel-mode vRouters
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports huge pages in environments where compute nodes are using kernel-mode vRouters and the environment is deployed using Red Hat Openstack or Juju. Huge page support for kernel-mode vRouters allows the Zero Impact Upgrade (ZIU) procedure to complete OpenSDN software upgrades without rebooting compute nodes. 

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/install-tf-rhosp-ziu.html>`_

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/deploying-tf-using-juju-charms.html>`_

Zero Impact Upgrade: OpenSDN Networking Software Upgrades in Environments Deployed using Ansible
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports the Zero Impact Upgrade (ZIU) procedure to upgrade OpenSDN Networking software in environments that are deployed using Ansible. For additional information, see How to Perform a Zero Impact OpenSDN Networking Upgrade using Ansible.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/installing-tf-ansible-ziu.html>`_

Support for Octavia as LBaaS
----------------------------

OpenSDN now supports Octavia as LBaaS. The Neutron LBaaS plugin is no longer available in OpenStack Train release. If you want to use legacy OpenSDN load balancer, you can use VNC or the OpenSDN Web UI. 

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/canonical-octavia.html>`_

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-installation-and-upgrade-guide/rhosp-octavia.html>`_

Support for Fast Routing Convergence
------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports fast convergence of the network in case of failures in the overlay tunnel endpoints. With the fast convergence feature, OpenSDN can detect and respond to failures in the gateway or vRouter and take corrective action faster, thereby reducing the convergence time. Convergence time is the time taken by the control plane to detect a failure and take corrective action. Faster convergence reduces the risk of silent packet drop in case of a failure in the network.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-service-provider-focused-features-guide/fast-routing-convergence.html>`_

Configurable XMPP Timeout
-------------------------

OpenSDN now allows you to configure the XMPP timer value in the range 1 through 90 seconds. Reducing the timer to a lower value facilitates faster convergence in the network. Though you can configure a value as low as one (1), the recommended value is nine (9). A lower value for the timer is recommended only for smaller clusters.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-service-provider-focused-features-guide/fast-routing-convergence.html>`_

VLAN Forwarding Disabled for DPDK vRouters Deployed on VLAN Interfaces
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now has VLAN forwarding on interfaces disabled by default on DPDK vRouters that are deployed in a cluster. This optimizes the performance of DPDK enabled vRouters.

In releases prior VLAN forwarding interface is enabled by default, enabling packet forwarding between the host and the fabric. This resulted in increased load on vRouters affecting their performance.

To enable VLAN forwarding interface on vRouter, set the value for DPDK_ENABLE_VLAN_FWRD to True in contrail-settings.yaml. If VLAN forwarding interface is enabled, the following message is logged in the contrail-vrouter-dpdk container logs:

VLAN forwarding is enabled and causing performance impact on the system

Support for Viewing Details of a DPDK Enabled vRouter
-----------------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports the dpdkinfo command which enables you to see the details of the internal data structures of a DPDK enabled vRouter. The dpdkinfo command enables you to view information related to bond interfaces, Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), memory pool (mempool), Logical core (lcore), network interface card (NIC) and application. The dpdkinfo command reads the internal data structures and unstructured data from a DPDK enabled vRouter and displays the data on the console.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-monitoring-and-troubleshooting-guide/vrouter-cli-utilities-vnc.html#dpdkinfo-command>`_

Packet Latency Improvements in the vRouter
------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now has significant vRouter packet latency improvements in DPDK deployments. The latency for 64B packets is measured to be around 120 microseconds (µs) in release 2008 as against 300-400 µs prior to release 2008. In historic DPDK deployments, the vRouter functions in a hybrid mode where it uses part pipelining mode and part run-to-completion mode for packet processing thereby ensuring good load balancing and also reasonable latency. However, from release 2008, you can switch the vRouter from hybrid to run-to-completion mode where the packets are processed in a single session with no load balancing thereby reducing latency overheads. To switch DPDK modes, you must set the DPDK_COMMAND_ADDTIONAL_ARGS+= "--vr_no_load_balance" parameter in the ifcfg-vhost0 file on the vRouter.

This feature has the following caveats:

The run-to-completion mode has inherent disadvantages such as if the virtual machine is unable to load balance, you might see bottlenecks using this mode.

The VNF must be enabled with multiqueue virtio. This is to ensure that the VNF performs load balancing in place of the vRouter.

Only MPLSoUDP and VXLAN encapsulation protocols are supported.


Support for Clearing vif Statistics Counters
--------------------------------------------

OpenSDN now supports clearing of vif statistics counters for all interfaces by using the --clear command.

`<https://docs.opensdn.io/en/latest/opensdn-monitoring-and-troubleshooting-guide/vrouter-cli-utilities-vnc.html>`_

Contrail Tools Container
------------------------

Contrail-tools container provides a centralized location for all the available tools and CLI commands in one place. OpenSDN now features the contrail-tools command which will be installed by default. contrail-tools command enables you to log in to the container and execute the tool. Additionally, the command will kill the container on exit.
