RST conventions
===============

Tungsten Fabric documentation uses reStructuredText (RST) markup syntax
with Sphinx extensions.

RST is a powerful and straightforward markup language that, in combination
with Sphinx, provides a wide range of facilities for intelligent and
appealing documentation creation. It uses simple and implicit
syntax to introduce a variety of content elements such as titles,
code blocks, vertical lists, and many others. All the source content formatted
using RST is stored in files with the ``.rst`` extension.

To keep the documentation format consistent, follow the guidelines
included in this chapter for all the RST source content. When in doubt,
use simpler formatting.

.. note::

   All the examples provided in this chapter are for illustration purposes
   only and cannot be regarded as pieces of true technical information.
